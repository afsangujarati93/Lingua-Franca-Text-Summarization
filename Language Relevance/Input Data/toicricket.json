Bangladesh though lost their warm-up game against Afghanistan.\n", "\n", "And as far as first-class experience goes, it needs to be viewed with context: Bangladesh\u2019s National Cricket League is only 16 years old. One factor that Bangladesh will lean on is that they have already played a game at Queenstown, whereas India have not.\n", "\n", "And in Wright\u2019s book, that certainly counts for something. \u201cAbsolutely.

Even more curiously, the English fast bowlers took six Australian wickets, before Aussie leg-spinner Lloyd Pope took 8 for 35, the best figures in the tournament\u2019s history. Both India and Bangladesh traditionally rely heavily on spin bowling, and that will make it very interesting to see whether the same strip is used for Friday\u2019s game.\n", "\n", "The opposition may also call for a change in personnel in the Indian starting team.

He came from a large family and had lost his father several years earlier. He had no real qualifications, but with hope in his heart and the promise of working hard he showed up at a cousin\u2019s door. Luckily for Bethuel \u201cBabu\u201d Buthelezi, the cousin in question worked at the Wanderers Club, the swank members-only club that is only minutes away from the Bullring, as the Wanderers Cricket Ground in Johannesburg is best known. \n", "\n", "Buthelezi\u2019s job was to clean the swimming pool and the tennis courts, and, of course, mow the grass at the cricket ground.

It wasn\u2019t until 1992 that Babu would make the transition to the Wanderers Cricket Ground. \n", "\n", "And you must remember that the period between 1984 and 1992 was among the most difficult in South Africa\u2019s history. Apartheid was still very much in force, black and white people were segregated, and the norm was to have white people in positions of power or responsibility and black people working under them.

In 2000, three days of South Africa\u2019s Test against New Zealand were washed out and still two full days of cricket were conjured up by the ground staff, which included our Babu.

Babu, who did not play cricket himself, learnt most of his craft from Scott, on the job, but he would also pick the brain of Clive Rice, the legendary all-rounder who plied his trade at the ground. This in itself is unusual for Rice was hardly an advocate of transformation. It wasn\u2019t until 1999 that Babu got formal training in the art of making pitches, although there wasn\u2019t anything that he didn\u2019t already know about the job. Babu has not been in charge of this ground for too long and this will be only the third pitch he is producing by himself. \n", "\n", "Of course, he\u2019s still regularly in touch with Scott, who is always around to share his experience and wisdom. From being a black man who came in search of a job and worked under a white man, Babu is now the one who gives the orders.

Khan, who was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for $1.41 million in IPL auction, has taken 86 wickets in 37 ODIs.

I mean no disrespect to the book or Mr Brearley, who I admire a great deal, but books or team meetings don\u2019t make you good captains. For me, the art of captaincy was not theory but practice. \n", "\n", "I wanted to lead my own way and create a new template for success. I was aware, too, that we were at a very, very critical stage in Indian cricket. We had a spate of defeats plus all kind of stories were circulating in the media.\n", "\n", "Some involved the team and a few particular players. The dark days of match fixing era were slowly coming to light. The unit was battered and demoralised. It was not easy to pick the team up from this slump. I knew my job was going to be very tough. Later I realised heroes were created out of such situations.\n", "\n", "I had one overriding aim. I wanted the team to perform well overseas. We had beaten Australia at home and played some truly extraordinary cricket. But I knew what counted was winning abroad. Wherever India went, be it South Africa, Australia or New Zealand, we had the same model.\n", "\n", " We kept on playing spinners and our opponents gleefully ensured there wasn\u2019t a single dry patch on the pitch. It made our one-dimensional attack completely ineffective. The day I became the captain I told myself this age-old policy had to change.\n", "\n", "Enough of romance. We needed to get real. I wanted to build a bank of fit and strong fast bowlers and create a new template. I told myself that within the subcontinent, the emphasis would be on spinners. But outside, the pacers would have to assume primary responsibility for picking 20 wickets.\n", "\n", "I was inspired by the way the Aussies played their cricket. It was no-holds barred. They played to win. I wanted to imbibe the same spirit here. And while attempting to win if I lost I didn\u2019t mind. I wanted to create a culture of winning and absolutely detested draws.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "It took about a year for my reforms to fully show through. I knew I had really succeeded in 2002, when we were playing the Champions Trophy in Colombo. One day a journalist came and told me how Wasim Akram had complimented this new look Indian team. Akram saw us turn the England match away from the brink of defeat. Mohammad Kaif and I both got hundreds in the match and we survived a knockout scare. \n", "\n", "My team reminded Akram of the legendary Pakistan team of the \u201980s, where the dressing room didn\u2019t believe they could lose. That is why they came back from death on multiple occasions. For me the praise couldn\u2019t have got any bigger! How did I create such a team? It wasn\u2019t about the individual talent. It was about the culture. My captaincy model was characterised by two distinctive pillars. Proper identification of talent and then ensuring the young finds play fearless cricket. \n", "\n", "The toughest challenge for an Indian captain was to keep track of talented domestic players as he was touring most of the time. I had to delegate the responsibility to one or two selectors who I trusted almost blindly. My policy was simple. East, west, north or south didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was the player\u2019s personal skill. I wanted complete honesty in team selection.\n", "\n", "As soon as I became captain, I told the selectors, please look for someone who bowls with a bit of zip. If you find someone like that, don\u2019t keep him in domestic cricket. Pick him straightaway for India. This is why Zaheer Khan played so few domestic matches before the selectors picked him for the Champions Trophy in Nairobi. And suddenly he found himself standing with the new ball against the mighty Adam Gilchrist.\n", "\n", "Ian Chappell once told me that when you go to bed at night, you must be absolutely sure, from the bottom of your heart, that you have been honest and treated every player on his own merit. That you selected every player because you felt he was good enough and deserved a place. \n", "\n", "In the process you might make a few mistakes. It does not matter. It has happened to every captain in history. It will happen also in the future. But what mattered was that your intention had to be right. There are captains who will compromise and there are some who will not, he said. The second types last longer.\n", "\n", "Once I picked a player I supported him all the way. Unless a young player gets the confidence and security to play over some time, how will he perform? Will he ever be relaxed to be at his best? I had seen this in my own life, as a young cricketer trying to break it to the big league. I had been full of doubts and uncertainties \u2014 unsure if I was going to be picked or dropped. This anxiety ate into my game. This was an issue I addressed while I became the captain.\n", "\n", "I believed in throwing the younger players at the deep end. The better ones did handle themselves, swam their way and came up against the odds. Harbhajan Singh, for instance. The selectors wanted to drop him after the Mumbai Test against Australia in 2001. They wanted to play Sarandeep Singh. But I resisted. I had seen a spark in Harbhajan and he justified my faith by almost single-handedly winning us the series.\n", "\n", "Then at the South Africa tour selection, Madan Lal, the North Zone selector, did not want to pick Virender Sehwag. Madan felt Sehwag would find it difficult to score on those pacey, bouncy pitches of South Africa. But I backed Viru and was proved right.\n", "\n", "We debuted Yuvraj Singh in 2000 in the Champions Tropy in Nairobi. He impressed the cricketing world right away. People say how difficult it was to manage Yuvi and all that. Nonsense. Handling him was never a problem. Yes, he would meet his friends and have parties. But it didn\u2019t matter as long as he won you matches like he did in the very first one in Nairobi. It was talent that counted.\n", "\n", "Along with coach John Wright, we managed to create an atmosphere where match winners were rewarded, irrespective of their age and experience. And this is why we saw the likes of Yuvraj, Kaif, Sehwag, Parthiv came up in the way they did.\n", "\n", "\n", "I used another psychological trick to motivate my young warriors even further. Off the field, I was docile, introvertish, a little withdrawn even. Now I changed my on-field personality and became aggressive. I learnt this tactic accidentally in the famous Eden Gardens Test in 2001. It was a tense game and I noticed that quite a few of our players were reacting aggressively to the pressure tactics of the Australians. They were giving it back.\n", "\n", "I decided to use the same approach in the future. I would pick up a fight with the opponent just to get Harbhajan or Zaheer Khan fired up. Our coach successfully tried the same trick on me. Before the legendary Nat-West final in 2002, I had a disagreement with John and we were not talking. Once we won that match and started celebrating, I noticed an arm tapping my shoulder. I turned around and saw the coach, who smilingly said that the fight was his idea to pump me up for the big final. I scored 60 in that match from just 43 balls.\n", "\n", "The battle to win \u2014 on the pitch and in the boardroom \u2014 begins and ends in one\u2019s head. And the leader is the driver of this winning spirit. This is why Greg Chappell couldn\u2019t succeed in India. He didn\u2019t manage to create an atmosphere to win. The team under him did their net sessions with utmost sincerity, the required laps on the ground. \n", "\n", "They were well disciplined. But to win Test matches overseas you needed something more than that. You needed someone to tell you that if you had done it once, there was no reason why you couldn\u2019t do it again. Chappell\u2019s Team India lacked that fighting spirit, the energy.\n", "\n", "Kolkata Knight Riders\u2019 dismal performance in the second season of the IPL, the worst in its history, was another case in point. Our coach John Buchanan had decided that we play football-style where unlike cricket it is the manager, not the captain, who is all important. He decided to appoint multiple captains for the team, even going so far as to decide the batting order himself. Not surprisingly, our performance in the tournament was awful. I performed badly as my mind was all messed up.\n", "\n", "As we kept losing matches, panic set in among the team members. The supply line was very poor as we did not have a solid reserve bench. The IPL was different from the national team in so many ways. Here the auction was all important. You could even afford to lose a few matches but a bad auction meant you were hobbled for three successive years. The damage was much bigger.\n", "\n", "Confidence is the most important cologne that a cricket dressing room can wear. But our unit had none of that. We were a shellshocked bunch of players who were praying for the season to end. Not even one player in that team, including Brendon McCullum, the main captain seemed happy. And this feeling showed in our terrible performance.\n", "\n", "My greatest achievement as a captain was that the team truly became resilient during my tenure. Toughening them up was part of the winner-takes-all strategy. My decision to bat at the Headingley Test in 2002 after winning the toss has to be viewed in this context. Cricket fans were confused that I chose to bat first on a green pitch -- Indian captains have historically avoided taking such chance.\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "I intentionally did the opposite of what was expected as I wanted our batting line-up to soak in that pressure. We ended up winning the Test by an innings. Anil Kumble later remarked it was our defining victory of that era as it showed that India could win in adverse overseas conditions.\n", "\n", "I particularly remember a meeting in Australia where the players were discussing high security risks of the forthcoming Pakistan tour and wondering if it would be safe to travel there. Quite a few said it would be very risky and that we must express our unavailability to the board in writing. But six or seven players of the group put their hands up and said, we must go and take this opportunity to beat Pakistan in Pakistan, which had never happened before. I felt so proud!\n", "\n", "Being a leader has two parts -- the first is creating a fantastic team and a winning culture. This we have talked about. I now want to focus on the second part which is equally important -- and that's yourself. Here's what I learnt. Being the boss puts you in the spotlight like nothing else. The biggest barrier to performance is constant criticism. The thick-skinned ones absorb it well but the sensitive one gets deeply affected. Cricket is such a mind game that if you get even slightly affected, you will be unable to play fearlessly. So if you are looking for a high quality performance you will have to learn to quickly send unwanted criticism to spam.\n", "\n", "My take on this is simple. Criticism is part and parcel of professional life. If you do not get criticised in your profession it will mean that your profession is not important enough. In any path of life, if you get accolades be also prepared for brickbats. It comes with the package. I always knew it and did not lose any sleep over it.\n", "\n", "The job also brings unbelievable amount of pressure. Look at MS Dhoni. He turned grey. Look at me. I lost so much hair. Stress will be with you as long as you continue to attempt breaking barriers, set targets or retain your reputation. In my career there were moments when the pressure seemed unbearable. Yet I never ran away from it. The rule of the professional jungle suggests that to win battles, you have to embrace pressure and not get frightened.\n", "\n", "Everyone has their own way of coping with stress. Mine was music. Like quite a few Indian players, I used to carry my own music system on the tour and had an impressive collection of retro songs -- from Kishore Kumar to Kumar Sanu. From Asha Bhosle to Abhijeet. From Sonu Nigam to Shaan. Lata Mangeshkar remains a particular favourite. You too will need to develop your own strategies to stay calm.\n", "\n", "Leadership is an amazing disease. It either cures you or kills you. I have seen captains turn into different individuals once they are offered the job. I have seen personalities of captains change completely as soon as they are at the helm. But if you can rise to its challenges, prove yourself equal to its demands, it's the best job in the world. \n", "\n"]},

Cheteshwar Pujara was seriously optimistic when he suggested that India could score 350 in the final innings. But, South Africa will hope to have such a score on the board, because they can attack with the new ball, pull things back as the ball gets older and then still have enough runs to have another crack with the second new ball. \n", "\n", "The key to doing this, however, will be AB de Villiers and du Plessis, as South Africa have gone into this Test a batsman short.

There is consistency in the way Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah have sprung together a pace partnership, having played together in 12 of India\u2019s last 14 matches.

What is India\u2019s second line of attack in the pace department? Further, like spinners, isn\u2019t it vital to give game time to fast bowlers? There is an underlying lack of coherency with which India are going about this experimental phase. On the one hand, too many names are given trial runs, even a consistent string of matches without the desired result \u2014 the No. 4 spot is a case in point. On the other hand, the team management has adopted a unilateral approach, vis-\u00e0-vis fast bowling. There is no discernible streamlined process throughout the playing eleven. Instead a mad-hoc chop and change policy, enhanced by the need to afford rest to key players ahead of a hectic foreign tours.\n", "\n", "Perhaps best exemplified in the peculiar case of Rahane.

In Kohli\u2019s absence, it was imperative to give him a run of three innings against Sri Lanka to garner his confidence back. It was an easy enough opportunity that stand-in skipper Rohit squandered on a green-top wicket in Dharamsala.\n", "\n", "\u201cHe is an opening batsman and we don\u2019t want to keep changing his batting slot.

By definition, No. 3 indeed is a top-order slot, even if the team management didn\u2019t want to bat Rahane any lower. Sure, they wanted to give Shreyas Iyer a go. But what\u2019s the hurry? The debutant batted at No. 3, a spot ordinarily unavailable, so what was the point herein? In his last 11 ODIs, Rahane has scored 585 runs including one hundred and three half-centuries. It is feasible that reappearance in blue might have instilled confidence back in him, never mind that among current Indian batsmen he is technically best suited to the kind of green-top laid out in Dharamsala.

Smuts skied one off Bhuvneshwar and Dhawan took a well-judged catch at mid-on. Two overs later, Raina took a similarly well-judged catch running back from mid-wicket, this time sending back JP Duminy (3) off Bhuvneshwar as well as the hosts managed only 41/2 at the end of the powerplays.

Hendricks reached his maiden T20 half-century off 37 balls while Jasprit Bumrah (0-32) had a moment of brilliance at the boundary, pulling the ball back in with an acrobatic jump. But it was six still, as per new rules, as his last touch was on the rope. \n", "\n", "South Africa crossed 100 in the 12th over even as the asking rate touched 13 per over.

But Bhuvneshwar returned to deal them a quick double blow, removing both Klaasen and Hendricks in the space of four balls.

He was caught behind off Junior Dala (2-47), trying to play over slips, with South Africa opting for DRS referral. Surprisingly, Suresh Raina (15) came out at no.3 and played a handy little cameo. India had hit 5 sixes before the fifth over was completed. Raina and Dhawan put on 26 runs off 13 balls, with the former smashing two fours and a six. \n", "\n", "Raina skied a pull shot off Dala and the bowler gleefully accepted the catch.

The first sign of victory was when on a green top and despite playing five fast bowlers, Virat opted to bat first. He was soon trolled on social media but twitteratti weren\u2019t playing in South Africa. Virat & Co were. The captain had nailed it by exposing his batsmen to the harshest of conditions.

Not lose concentration when he had just scored 1 off the first 15 balls. He made the adjustment and the release shot off Rabada that went for a massive six, defined the transformation.

A slow slow leg break and Miller\u2019s stumps were soon shattered. He had played over the ball and had lost the battle of attrition. Twenty-five years of invincibility at home against India was shattered. The mind had been tamed and so was South Africa.\n", "\n", "India might yet again lose the Test series in England in August and subsequently in Australia in December. Kohli might yet again fail against Anderson and Broad. Rohit might yet again falter against Mitchell Starc. And Chahal and Kuldeep may well be hit out of the park by Warner and Smith and Root. But none of this will matter to the Indians any more. For they will try again. And try harder. And even when they fail they will pick themselves up to try and fail better.

That will obviously be a discussion with higher levels, with (ECB director of cricket) Andrew Strauss and people like that.", "\"Obviously, Paul Farbrace, I think, would do a grand job. When I was a number two, years ago, a bloke said to me the role of the number two is to make the number one look good. I think he's done a good job in that respect.\"", "England were knocked out of the T20 tri-series on Sunday after a win against New Zealand was not enough to proceed to the final against Australia in Auckland on Wednesday.", "Bayliss said he has been considering stepping down as T20 coach because of the increasing demands of the job across the three formats.", "\"From the start of May last year, I think we have 21 months of cricket out of 23 \u2013 and we're halfway through that,\" he added.

India strode to a comfortable win at Centurion as they reached their victory target with 107 balls to spare after putting South Africa into bat and bowling them out for 204.

", "He scored 129 not out to set a new record for the most runs in a six-match ODI series.

", "\"The Dutch association asked to me help out in the bid to qualify and I thought I'd give it another go and I'm really pleased that I did,\" the South African-born all-rounder told Reuters in an interview.", "Ten Doeschate was due to play in South Africa's Global Twenty 20 competition at the end of last year but when it was cancelled he went with the Dutch team to Dubai where they successfully won a place in the final qualifiers in Zimbabwe.

I don't think the number of games you get granted is a measure of how much you have improved. ", "\"Having a first hand account of things after being absent for six years, I can assure you the Dutch team has improved drastically. I can honestly say that I think all the Dutch boys are up to county cricket standard.\" ", "The Netherlands are paired with former World Cup winners West Indies as well as Ireland, Papua New Guinea and the United Arab Emirates in Group A in Harare.

", "\"TOUGH CRICKET\"", "\"It will be tough to qualify, but we certainly have a squad that can play consistently good cricket,\" he said.  \"An upset now wouldn't be of the scale it was 10 or even five years ago. Zimbabwe and the West Indies are the obvious hurdles but there is a lot of tough cricket to be played with the likes of Ireland and Afghanistan.\" ", "The Dutch previously played at the 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011 tournaments.

", "But his role in leading Essex to winning the Division Two and Division One titles in county cricket in successive seasons has emphasised his prowess in all forms of the game. ", "\"It is the standout moment for me. Particularly after being promoted in 2016. It's different to winning other competitions, like an Indian Premier League,\" he said. ", "\"It felt like the reward of a life's long labour. Also being emotionally attached to the players, the staff and a lot of other people who are involved with the club over a long period of time makes it more special.\" ", "He will be back again for the coming season after which he will be hoping the World Cup beckons. ", "\"As long as I'm adding value at Essex I'd like to keep playing,\" he said. ", "\"I'm also acutely aware that there's a right time for change and I don't want to be hanging on when there are young players coming through. We have a good crop of youngsters simmering on the verge of first class cricket, so it's more up to them than it is me.\"", " (Editing by Nick Mulvenney)"]},
